title: "Adding a 404 Page"
---

To create a 404 page create a page whose path matches the regex
`/404*`. Most often you'll want to create a React component page at
`src/pages/404.js`.

Gatsby ensures that your 404 page is built as `404.html` as many static hosting
platforms default to using this as your 404 error page. If you're hosting your
site another way, you'll need to setup a custom rule to serve this file for 404
errors.

When developing, Gatsby adds a default 404 page that overrides your custom 404
page. But you can still preview your 404 page by clicking "Preview custom 404
page" to verify that it's working as expected.
