You may be looking to build a plugin that doesn't exist yet, or you may just be curious to know more about the anatomy of a Gatsby plugin. We'll review:

1.  the core concepts of what a Gatsby plugin is
2.  naming conventions for the plugin title
3.  expected files in a plugin package
4.  defining a local (unpublished) plugin for your own use case
5.  how to publish your plugin to the library

## Core Concepts

- Each Gatsby plugin can be created as an npm package or as a [local plugin](#local-plugins)
- A `package.json` is required
- Plugin implement the Gatsby APIs for [Node](/docs/node-apis/), [server-side rendering](/docs/ssr-apis/), and the [browser](/docs/browser-apis/)

## Plugin naming conventions

There are four standard plugin naming conventions for Gatsby:

- **`gatsby-source-*`** â€” a source plugin loads data from a given source (e.g. WordPress, MongoDB, the file system). Use this plugin type if you are connecting a new source of data to Gatsby.
  - Example: [`gatsby-source-contentful`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-contentful)
  - Docs: [create a source plugin](/docs/create-source-plugin/)
- **`gatsby-transformer-*`** â€” a transformer plugin converts data from one format (e.g. CSV, YAML) to a JavaScript object. Use this naming convention if your plugin will be transforming data from one format to another.
  - Example: [`gatsby-transformer-yaml`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-yaml)
- **`gatsby-[plugin-name]-*`** â€” if a plugin is a plugin for another plugin ðŸ˜…, it should be prefixed with the name of the plugin it extends (e.g. if it adds emoji to the output of `gatsby-transformer-remark`, call it `gatsby-remark-add-emoji`). Use this naming convention whenever your plugin will be included as a plugin in the `options` object of another plugin.
  - Example: [`gatsby-remark-images`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-remark-images)
- **`gatsby-plugin-*`** â€” this is the most general plugin type. Use this naming convention if your plugin doesnâ€™t meet the requirements of any other plugin types.
  - Example: [`gatsby-plugin-sharp`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp)

## What files does Gatsby look for in a plugin?

All files are optional unless specifically marked as required.

- `package.json` â€” [required] this can be an empty object (`{}`) for local plugins
  - `name` is used to identify the plugin when it mutates Gatsbyâ€™s GraphQL data structure
    - if `name` isnâ€™t set, the folder name for the plugin is used
  - `version` is used to manage the cache â€” if it changes, the cache is cleared
    - if `version` isnâ€™t set, an MD5 hash of the `gatsby-*` file contents is used to invalidate the cache
    - omitting the `version` field is recommended for local plugins
  - `keywords` is used to make your plugin discoverable
    - plugins published on the npm registry should have `gatsby` and `gatsby-plugin` in the `keywords` field to be added to the [Plugin Library](/packages/)
- `gatsby-browser.js` â€” usage details are in the [browser API reference](/docs/browser-apis/)
- `gatsby-node.js` â€” usage details are in the [Node API reference](/docs/node-apis/)
- `gatsby-ssr.js` â€” usage details are in the [SSR API reference](/docs/ssr-apis/)

## Local plugins

If a plugin is only relevant to your specific use-case, or if youâ€™re developing a plugin and want a simpler workflow, a locally defined plugin is a convenient way to create and manage your plugin code.

Place the code in the `plugins` folder in the root of your project like this:

```
plugins
â””â”€â”€ my-own-plugin
    â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

**NOTE:** You still need to add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js`. There is no auto-detection of local plugins.

Like all `gatsby-*` files, the code is not processed by Babel. If you want
to use JavaScript syntax which isn't supported by your version of Node.js, you
can place the files in a `src` subfolder and build them to the plugin folder
root.

## Publishing a plugin to the library

In order to add your plugin to the [Plugin Library], you need to publish a package to npm (learn how [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)) with the [required files](#what-files-does-gatsby-look-for-in-a-plugin) and **include a `keywords` field** to `package.json` containing `gatsby` and `gatsby-plugin`.

After doing so, Algolia will take up to 12 hours to add it to the library search index (the exact time necessary is still unknown), and wait for the daily rebuild of https://gatsbyjs.org to automatically include your plugin page to the website. Then, all you have to do is share your wonderful plugin with the community!

**NOTE:** You can include other _relevant_ keywords to your `package.json` file to help interested users in finding it. As an example, a Markdown MathJax transformer would include:

```
"keywords": [
  "gatsby",
  "gatsby-plugin",
  "gatsby-transformer-plugin",
  "mathjax",
  "markdown",
]
```
