Welcome to Part Four of the tutorial! Halfway through! Hope things are starting
to feel pretty comfortable ðŸ˜€

## Recap of first half of the tutorial

So far, you've been learning how to use React.jsâ€”how powerful it is to be able to
create your _own_ components to act as custom building blocks for websites.

Youâ€™ve also explored styling components using CSS Modules.

## What's in this tutorial?

In the next four parts of the tutorial (including this one), you'll be diving into the Gatsby data layer, which is a powerful feature of Gatsby that lets you easily build sites from Markdown, WordPress, headless CMSs, and other data sources of all flavors.

**NOTE:** Gatsbyâ€™s data layer is powered by GraphQL. For an in-depth tutorial on
GraphQL, we recommend [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/).

## Data in Gatsby

A website has four parts, HTML, CSS, JS, and data. The first half of the
tutorial focused on the first three. Let's learn now how to use data in Gatsby
sites.

What is data?

A very computer science-y answer would be: data is things like `"strings"`,
integers (`42`), objects (`{ pizza: true }`), etc.

For the purpose of working in Gatsby, however, a more useful answer is
"everything that lives outside a React component".

So far, you've been writing text and adding images _directly_ in components.
Which is an _excellent_ way to build many websites. But, often you want to store
data _outside_ components and then bring the data _into_ the component as
needed.

For example, if you're building a site with WordPress (so other contributors
have a nice interface for adding & maintaining content) and Gatsby, the _data_
for the site (pages and posts) are in WordPress and you _pull_ that data, as
needed, into your components.

Data can also live in file types like Markdown, CSV, etc. as well as databases
and APIs of all sorts.

**Gatsby's data layer lets you pull data from these (and any other source)
directly into your components**â€”in the shape and form you want.

## How Gatsby's data layer uses GraphQL to pull data into components

There are many options for loading data into React components. One of the most
popular and powerful of these is a technology called
[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/).

GraphQL was invented at Facebook to help product engineers _pull_ needed data into
components.

GraphQL is a **q**uery **l**anguage (the _QL_ part of its name). If you're
familiar with SQL, it works in a very similar way. Using a special syntax, you describe
the data you want in your component and then that data is given
to you.

Gatsby uses GraphQL to enable components to declare the data they need.

## Create a new example site

Let's create another new site for this part of the tutorial. You're going to build a Markdown blog called "Pandas Eating Lots". It's dedicated to showing off the best pictures and videos of pandas eating lots of food. Along the way you'll be dipping your toes into GraphQL and Gatsby's Markdown support.

Open a new terminal window and run the following commands to create a new Gatsby site in a directory called `tutorial-part-four`, and navigate to the new directory:

```shell
gatsby new tutorial-part-four https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world#v2
cd tutorial-part-four
```

Then install some other needed dependencies at the root of the project. You'll use the Typography theme
"Kirkham", and you'll try out a CSS-in-JS library, ["Emotion"](https://emotion.sh/):

```shell
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-typography typography react-typography typography-theme-kirkham gatsby-plugin-emotion@next emotion react-emotion emotion-server
```

Let's set up a site similar to what you ended with in [Part Three](/tutorial/part-three). This site will have a layout component and two page components:

`src/components/layout.js`

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { css } from "react-emotion"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

import { rhythm } from "../utils/typography"

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div
    className={css`
      margin: 0 auto;
      max-width: 700px;
      padding: ${rhythm(2)};
      padding-top: ${rhythm(1.5)};
    `}
  >
    <Link to={`/`}>
      <h3
        className={css`
          margin-bottom: ${rhythm(2)};
          display: inline-block;
          font-style: normal;
        `}
      >
        Pandas Eating Lots
      </h3>
    </Link>
    <Link
      to={`/about/`}
      className={css`
        float: right;
      `}
    >
      About
    </Link>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

`src/pages/index.js`

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/layout"

export default () => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>Amazing Pandas Eating Things</h1>
    <div>
      <img
        src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BMP2l6Hwvp4/TiAxeGx4CTI/AAAAAAAAD_M/XlC_mY3SoEw/s1600/panda-group-eating-bamboo.jpg"
        alt="Group of pandas eating bamboo"
      />
    </div>
  </Layout>
)
```

`src/pages/about.js`

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/layout"

export default () => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>About Pandas Eating Lots</h1>
    <p>
      We're the only site running on your computer dedicated to showing the best
      photos and videos of pandas eating lots of food.
    </p>
  </Layout>
)
```

`src/utils/typography.js`

```javascript
import Typography from "typography"
import kirkhamTheme from "typography-theme-kirkham"

const typography = new Typography(kirkhamTheme)

export default typography
export const rhythm = typography.rhythm
```

`gatsby-config.js` (must be in the root of your project, not under src)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-emotion`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-typography`,
      options: {
        pathToConfigModule: `src/utils/typography`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Add the above files and then run `gatsby develop`, per usual, and you should see the following:

![start](start.png)

You have another small site with a layout and two pages.

Now let's start querying ðŸ˜‹

## Your first GraphQL query

When building sites, you'll probably want to reuse common bits of data -- like the _site title_ for example. Look at the `/about/` page. You'll notice that you have the site title (`Pandas Eating Lots`) in both the layout component (the site header) as well as in the `<h1/>` of the `about.js` page (the page header).

But what if you want to change the site title in the future? You'd have to search for the title across all your components and edit each instance. This is both cumbersome and error-prone, especially for larger, more complex sites. Instead, you can store the title in one location and reference that location from other files; Change the title in a single place, and Gatsby will _pull_ your updated title into files that reference it.

The place for these common bits of data is the `siteMetadata` object in the `gatsby-config.js` file. Let's add your site title to the `gatsby-config.js` file:

```javascript{2-4}
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Title from siteMetadata`,
  },
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-emotion`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-typography`,
      options: {
        pathToConfigModule: `src/utils/typography`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Restart the development server.

### Use a page query

Now the site title is available to be queried; Let's add it to the `about.js` file using a [page query](/docs/page-query):

```jsx{2,5,7,14-23}
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import Layout from "../components/layout"

export default ({ data }) => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>About {data.site.siteMetadata.title}</h1>
    <p>
      We're the only site running on your computer dedicated to showing the best
      photos and videos of pandas eating lots of food.
    </p>
  </Layout>
)

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`
```

It worked! ðŸŽ‰

![Page title pulling from siteMetadata](/site-metadata-title.png)

The basic GraphQL query that retrieves the `title` in our `layout.js` changes above is:

```
{
  site {
    siteMetadata {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ In [part five](/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql), we'll meet a tool that lets us interactively explore the data available through GraphQL, and help formulate queries like the one above.

Page queries live outside of the component definition -- by convention at the end of a page component file -- and are only available on page components.

### Use a StaticQuery

[StaticQuery](/docs/static-query/) is a new API introduced in Gatsby v2 that allows non-page components (like our `layout.js` component), to retrieve data via GraphQL queries.

Go ahead and add a `<StaticQuery/>` to your `src/components/layout.js` file, and a `{data.site.siteMetadata.title}` reference that uses this data. When you are done your file looks like this:

```jsx{3,8-18,35,48}
import React from "react"
import { css } from "react-emotion"
import { StaticQuery, Link, graphql } from "gatsby"

import { rhythm } from "../utils/typography"

export default ({ children }) => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            title
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={data => (
      <div
        className={css`
          margin: 0 auto;
          max-width: 700px;
          padding: ${rhythm(2)};
          padding-top: ${rhythm(1.5)};
        `}
      >
        <Link to={`/`}>
          <h3
            className={css`
              margin-bottom: ${rhythm(2)};
              display: inline-block;
              font-style: normal;
            `}
          >
            {data.site.siteMetadata.title}
          </h3>
        </Link>
        <Link
          to={`/about/`}
          className={css`
            float: right;
          `}
        >
          About
        </Link>
        {children}
      </div>
    )}
  />
)
```

Another success! ðŸŽ‰

![Page title and layout title both pulling from siteMetadata](/site-metadata-two-titles.png)

But let's restore the real title.

One of the core principles of Gatsby is that _creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating_ ([hat tip to Bret Victor](http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/02/transcript-of-inventing-on-principle/)). In other words, when you make any change to code you should immediately see the effect of that change. You manipulate an input of Gatsby and you see the new output showing up on the screen.

So almost everywhere, changes you make will immediately take effect. Edit the `gatsby-config.js` file again, this time changing the `title` back to "Pandas Eating Lots". The change should show up very quickly in your site pages.

## What's coming next?

Next, you'll be learning about how to pull data into your Gatsby site using
GraphQL with source plugins in [part five](/tutorial/part-five/) of the
tutorial.
